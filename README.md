# hex-pygame
 This project is the implimentation of my C++ hex project but using the pygame library for Python. 
 The C++ code can be found at: https://github.com/atpugh20/c-and-cpp-course/blob/main/cpp2/newHex.cpp.

 This program relies on:
 - Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithm to find the winning path
 - Monte Carlo method to allow the CPU to make a move
