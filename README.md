# hex-pygame
 This project is the implimentation of my C++ hex project but using the pygame library for Python. 
 The C++ code can be found at: https://github.com/atpugh20/c-and-cpp-course/blob/main/cpp2/newHex.cpp.

 This program relies on:
 - Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithm to find the winning path
 - Monte Carlo method to allow the CPU to make a move

Installation file:
- Windows: "hex_windows.exe"
- Linux: "hex_linux.exe"


How To Play:

In Hex, you and your opponent take turns placing down colored pieces on an 11x11 board. Each space is shaped like a hexagon. In order to win the game, you must create a full path in between both walls that match the same color as your pieces. In this interpretation, there are red and blue pieces, with the red player going first. There will always be a winner in hex, so there will be no ties.
